This project focuses on developing a high-performance image super-resolution system using the Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) model. 

Super-resolution is the process of enhancing the resolution of low-quality images to produce high-definition visuals, which is crucial in various fields such as medical imaging, satellite photography, and digital media restoration.
